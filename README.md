## About Abyss

Abyss is a framework focused on cross-platform development using an expressive and easy syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Abyss takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks such as:

* [ ] Much more coming soon
